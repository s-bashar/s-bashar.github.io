# Design choice 

To overcome the limitations of the RCA, CLA, and CSA, the parallel prefix adder (PPA) architecture has emerged as a promising solution. The PPA architecture addresses the challenge of carry propagation delays by utilizing a tree-like structure with multiple levels of carry computations. By leveraging parallel processing of carry signals, the PPA significantly reduces the critical path delay and enhances overall speed performance. This innovative architecture enables efficient carry signal propagation through various paths, allowing for faster addition of multi-bit numbers. The PPA offers improved performance and reduced latency compared to traditional adder architectures, making it an attractive choice for high-speed arithmetic operations. 
Two noteworthy variations of traditional PPA architecture include the Brent-Kung adder and the Kogge-Stone adder. The Brent-Kung adder offers improved power efficiency because of its lowest area delay with large number of input bits. However, the large number of levels in this architecture reduces its operational speed [7]. The Kogge-Stone adder has minimal fan-out and logic depth. Thus, the Kogge-Stone adder architecture becomes one of the fastest adders that is favored in electronic technology. However, as a tradeoff the KSA has a larger area.

We choose to use dynamic logic over static complementary CMOS and other techniques since it offers us the chance to use less transistors, it requires N+2 transistors while static CMOS uses 2N and pseudo-NMOS uses N+1. Additional benefits compared are the smaller load capacitance, no static power, non-ratioed logic, it is also much faster since tpLH = 0 and tpHL is small and in pre-charge time is small. In general, about 1.3-2x faster than static CMOS. However, the downsides are high power consumption as well as noise leakage, charge sharing and inputs not being able to go from 1-0. We can still combat some of the issues by using a keeper transistor, extra pre-charge transistor and domino logic which we will get into. This influenced our design choice since we knew that we wanted to optimize for speed.

# Adder Blocks

## PG Cell

The Propagate-Generate Cell (PG Cell) is a crucial component among the three distinct cells employed in the construction of our 8-bit Kogge-Stone adder. This cell serves as a pre-processing stage, responsible for computing generate and propagate signals for each pair of input bits, denoted as A and B. The generation of these signals follows a well-defined logic, governed by the following equations:
pi = Ai âŠ• Bi
gi = Ai . Bi
